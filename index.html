        ##Getting Started

        Choose a modern web browser, like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/), that supports current web standards and has good development tools.

You can write code using your computer's default text editor, Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple), but choosing a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features will improve your work flow.

There are many free and paid [options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors). Today, we're going to use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). 

Improve your work flow with keyboard shortcuts. [Link to shortcut cheatsheet] TODO

        ##Anatomy of a Web Page

        **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is used to define the meaning of the content, known as [semantics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/) and to create the structure of the page.

        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the presentation layer used to define how the page will look (e.g. colours, fonts, etc).

        **JavaScript** is a programming language. This is usually used to defines the behaviour and interactions. (e.g. when the user scrolls down the page, do something)

        <br>

      ##HTML / XHTML / HTML5

What's the difference?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**:  Used to structure and define page content.

**XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)**: Reformed HTML based on XML. Syntax rules are more strict.

**HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language, revision 5)**: Most current version. Improved the support for multimedia and introduced new structural tags. Not supported in older browsers.

Basically, these three terms refer to different versions of the same language but are often just called HTML interchangeably.

The [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) (W3C) governs these web standards with specifications, guidelines, tools and recommendations.
    </section> -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##HTML Terminology

        **Elements:** Components that define structural objects such as paragraphs (`p`).

        **Tags:** Used to define HTML elements. Denoted by `<`angled brackets`>` (`shift` + `,` and `shift` + `.` ) Usually come in pairs (but not always) that open to mark the beginning of an element and close the element with a forward slash. 

        ```
        <tag>content here</tag>
        ```

        Tags can also be nested inside other tags. Just make sure they always close in the reverse order.
        ```
        <p>I am a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
        ```
        **Attributes:** provides additional information or instruction for the element and is included *inside* the opening HTML tag in the form of `attribute="value"`. (more on this later)

        ```
        <tag attribute="value">content</tag>
        ```

        ##Basic HTML document

        These are the basic HTML tags included on every web page. 

        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            All page content goes here!
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
          
        **DOCTYPE** - This is always the first line because it tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in. Can be written in lowercase or uppercase. 

        `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the doctype for HTML5 (the latest version of HTML).

        Here's what the previous version (XHTML) looks like.  HTML5 is much neater!

        ```
        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
        ```

            All page content goes here!
          </body>
        </html>
        ```
        **&lt;html>** - Identifies the document as HTML. Ancestor of all HTML elements. The `lang="en"` attribute is optional but recommended since it classifies the language and can be used for translation tools and improve quality of search results.

        **&lt;head>** - Contains info about the current page (more on this later). `<title>` must be included and defines the page title, which is then displayed in the browser toolbar, bookmarks and search engine results.

        **&lt;body>** - All content to be displayed in the browser window, also known as the viewport, goes here.

## Setting Up Your Work Flow

Inside of the folder you downloaded today (**llc-html-css**), there are many folders and files that contain different content.

```xml
llc-html-css-  TODO
  |-- framework (folder) // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
  |-- project (folder) // All the project files needed for today go in here
  |-- index.html // This is the file you are viewing right now. Do not edit!
```

For all of these commands (open, save, copy, etc), refer to your [keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html) or follow the instructions below.

1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.
1. Navigate to the **project** folder (inside the folder you downloaded with today's slides).  
With the entire folder selected, select **Open**. The folder will appear in the side bar.

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Class Exercise #1: Create your HTML page

        To create a web page, just name your file using the **.html** extension (just like .pdf for PDF files or .doc for Word files). It's good practice to name your home page as **index.html** because your web server maps to this file as its default page.

        (Remember, you can refer to your<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html) for these commands.)

        1. In Sublime, select **File > New File** to create a new file.
        1. Select **File > Save** to save & name your file.  Name it **index.html** and save it in the **project** folder.
        1. Let's add all of the basic HTML tags (hint: [Slide 9](index.html#slide9)) and save your changes.
        1. Right click or two-finger tap in Sublime and select **Open in Browser** to open the HTML file in your *default* browser. 

        If Chrome is not your default browser, go to your Window/Finder and navigate to the<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> **project** folder, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**

        File naming tips: use lowercase letters, avoid spaces and use dashes or underscores for multi-word file names (e.g. about-me.html).<!-- .element: class="footnote" -->

        Example for reference:<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [project/examples/index-ex1.html](project/examples/index-ex1.html)
      </script>
    </section>

    <!-- <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Good File Naming Habits

* Use lowercase letters. (e.g. about.html instead of About.html or ABOUT.html)
* Avoid s p a c e s. Underscores (_) or dashes (-) are valid. However, dashes are generally preferred for SEO (search engine optimization). (e.g. business-hours.html instead of business hours.html - The browser will interpret it as business%20hours.html)
* Avoid symbols like # & * in your file name.
* Keep your file names concise, yet meaningful. (e.g. about.html, contact.html instead of page1.html, page2.html)

These file naming tips can be applied to any files such as images, folders, CSS, etc.

      #Page Layout
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Planning the page layout

        An important part of creating a web page is planning how to structure the page using semantic markup and getting it ready to be styled by CSS.  You will likely make changes as you go along but it makes it easier to start with a basic page layout.

        If you don't have design to work from, many developers and designers like to start planning with a simple sketch. But for today, let's take a look at the final design and see how to group related elements to structure the page.

        There are many structural HTML tags that are used just for this purpose.

        ![final design sections](framework/img/workshop/project-final-sections.jpg)
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##Structural HTML tags

        The `<div>` tag is one of two HTML tags that has no semantic meaning. (`<span>` is the other.) It is used purely for grouping elements to create sections for laying out a page.

        `<div>` tags are often used with the `class` attribute to differentiate them (more on this later).  To create the page layout, the HTML could look something like this:

        ```xml
        <div class="nav">
          nav links here
        </div>

        <div class="header">
          header content here
        </div>

        <div class="about">
          about content here
        </div>

        <div class="extras">
          extra content here
        </div>

        <div class="footer">
          footer & contact info here
        </div>
        ```

        Be careful of "divitis"! Use the <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->`<div>` to *group* related elements to be styled together as one section. If you need to style a single element, like an `<h1>` for example, just style that element directly. The browser sees every element as a "box" so there&#39;s no need to put a box around a box!
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ##HTML5 Structural Elements

        In HTML5, new semantic tags were introduced to better describe blocks of content such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` and `<section>`. Using HTML5 tags, the previous example could look like this instead:

        ```xml
        <nav>
          nav links here
        </nav>

        <header>
          header content here
        </header>

        <section class="about">
          about content here
        </section>

        <section class="extras">
          extra content here
        </section>

        <footer>
          footer & contact info here
        </footer>
        ```
        
        `<div>` can still be used when no other tag properly describes the element. When in doubt, it&#39;s ok to continue to use `<div>`.

        ##Class Exercise #2: Page structure

        Without peeking at the previous slide, let&#39;s go into our text editor and add the general page layout using semantic HTML5 tags.

        We will need to add a nav, header, about section, extras section and the contact/footer.

        We can also use HTML comments to help organize the content.  The syntax is:

        ```xml
        <!--  comment goes in between here -->
        ```

        Example for reference:<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [project/examples/index-ex2.html](project/examples/index-ex2.html)

      <script type="text/template">
        ##Paragraphs & Headings
        
        Every new paragraph, whether it&#39;s one sentence or more, needs its own pair of `<p></p>` tags.

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        ```
        <br>
        There are six page headings tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Headings are used to describe the *hierarchy* of the page structure. Think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

          **Title** (`h1`) 

          1. Introduction (`h2`) 
          1. First supporting idea (`h2`)
            * point 1 (`h3`)
            * point 2 (`h3`)
            * point 3 (`h3`)
          1. Second supporting idea (`h2`)
            * point 1 (`h3`)
            * point 2 (`h3`)
          1. Conclusion (`h2`)
        
        ```xml
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h2>First supporting idea</h2>
        <h3>point 1</h3>
        <h3>point 2</h3>
        ...
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
          ##Headings & HTML5 Sectioning tags

          Prior to HTML5, the rule was to only use one `<h1>` per page.  With the introduction of HTML5 sectioning tags, each part of the document that uses a sectioning tag now gets its own outline.

          Read more about headings and HTML5<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document) and [here](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-truth-about-multiple-h1-tags-in-the-html5-era--webdesign-16824).

          ```xml
          <h1>Pre-HTML5 Heading Outline</h1>
          <div class="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

        ## Links / Anchor tag

        Links (hyperlinks) are represented by the anchor (`<a>`) tag. It also needs an `href` attribute to provide additional information, in this case, where the link should go to.

        #####Link to an external site
        ```xml
        <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>

        ```xml
        <a href="about.html">About page</a>
        ```

        #####Link to a specific spot on a page
        Add an `id` attribute to the tag where you would like the link to go to. In the `href` attribute value, use the `#` symbol followed by the id name, with no spaces.
        ```xml
        <a href="#linkSpot">Click this link to navigate to a spot on the page</a>
        ```
        ```xml
        <h2 id="linkSpot">This where you want the link to go TO.</h2>

        ##Exercise #4: Add links and navigation (10mins)

        Even though we&#39;re building a one-page website, we can still create a navigation and set the links to different parts of the page.

        1. In the `<nav>` section, add three links (Home, About, Contact) - they should link to the specific part of the matching page content. Hint! You&#39;ll need to use the `id` attribute.  
          <span class="footnote">(If you get stuck, refer to the previous slide for examples or ask a mentor!)</span>
        1. Add some links within your paragraphs.  You can nest the `<a>` tags within the `<p>` tags and just surround the text that you want show as a link.

        ```xml
        <p><a href="http://hbo.com/the-wire" target="_blank">Link example</a> in a paragraph.</p>
        <p>Another paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolo sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit laboriosam officia.</p>
        ```
        We currently don&#39;t have much content so the in page links won&#39;t jump to the page section if the content isn&#39;t long enough to scroll. Either, minimize the height of your browser or test it again when we add more content and styles.  It should look something like this:

        ##Lists 

        Ordered Lists are used for a items that should be displayed in a specific, numbered order. Two tags are required, (`<ol>`) and (`<li>`) to create the list. You can only put content within the `li` tags (list item), **not** the `ol` (ordered list). 

        ```xml
        <p>My top 5 tv shows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Wire</li>
          <li>Breaking Bad</li>
          <li>Homeland</li>
          <li>House of Cards</li>
          <li>Game of Thrones</li>
        </ol>
        ```

        Renders as:
        <div class="example">
          <p>My top 5 tv shows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Wire</li>
            <li>Breaking Bad</li>
            <li>Game of Thrones</li>
            <li>House of Cards</li>
            <li>Homeland</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        Unordered lists are similar but start with the unordered list tag (`<ul>`). This list of items do not depend on any specific order.

        ```xml
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Portfolio</li>
          <li>Blog</li>

        ##Exercise #5: Add social media/contact list (10mins)

        Add a list of links to your social media accounts and/email.  We can use an unordered list since the order doesn&#39;t matter.

        Be sure to nest the links (`<a>`) *inside* of the list item (`<li>`) as well. For emails, see the example below.  Note that the `href` value is different.  This syntax will automatically open the users email client when they click on the link.

        Example:
        ```
        <ul>
          <li><a href="mailto:me@email.com">me@email.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
        </ul>
        ```

          ##CSS overview

          CSS is a stylesheet language with its own syntax rules. It separates content from presentation. A style sheet contains a list of style rules.

          **Selectors:** used to determine which HTML element(s) to apply the styles to.  
          **Declarations:** style rules, written using `property: value` pairs, are wrapped by curly brackets `{}` and each must end with a semi-colon (;) to indicate that the instruction is complete.

          ```css
          selector {
            property: value;
          }
          ```

          **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to the element (e.g. color). Values are specific to the property (red). The following example below changes the font colour of all paragraphs to red.

          ```css
          p {
            color: red;
          }
          ```

        ##Referencing CSS

        There are three ways to include (a.k.a *reference*) CSS in an HTML page. Today we&#39;ll be using the recommended **external** method. This method links to a separate style sheet file (uses a `.css` file extension) to separate the CSS from the HTML document.

        The style sheet is referenced in the `<head>` of the document with a `<link>` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` (relationship) and `href`. The value of `href` points to the file location of the style sheet. 

        Though it is not required, css files are often saved in a separate css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.

        ```
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
        </head>
        ```
        <br>
        If you're curious, you can read more about the inline and internal referencing methods below:

        **INLINE**: Can be added to any HTML element using the `style` *attribute*.

        ```
        <p style="color:blue;">I'm writing CSS!</p>
        ```

        This technique is not as common because it's harder to maintain but it's good to know how it works, just in case.

        **INTERNAL**: Uses `<style>` and is included in the `<head>` element.

        ```    
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
            <style>
                h1 {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>paragraph</p>
        </body>
        ```

        This method is preferred over *inline* css, however it is still inefficient because if you had multiple web pages, the style block and any revisions would have to be replicated on every single page.

        ##Class Exercise #6: Create a CSS File

        Back in Sublime Text, create a new CSS file by selecting **File > New File** or use a [keyboard shortcut](shortcuts-cheatsheet.html). Name the file with a **.css** extension. Let&#39;s call it **styles.css** and add it to **index.html**.

        PRO TIP! Sublime Text has a shortcut.  Type "link" with no brackets, then the tab key. Voila!<!-- .element: class="footnote" -->

        ```
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
        ```

        Let&#39;s do a quick test to see if it is linked properly by adding a background color on the entire viewport.

        ```
        body {
          background: lightblue;

        ##Background images

        The `background` property can be used to add colours or background images. There are already a few to choose from in your project images folder.

        There are two ways to declare the `background` property. The value must inclue the file path to the the image file.

        ```css
        /* shorthand - this is a CSS comment by the way!*/
        background: url(path/to/image/file);
        ```
        ```css
        /* longhand */
        background-image: url(path/to/image/file);
        ```

        **Important:** Note the location of the CSS file.  Since it&#39;s inside of a folder, we need to adjust the file path to reflect that using `../` to indicate that the directory needs to move *up* and *out* of the containing folder.

        ```css
        background: url(../path/to/image/file);
        ```

        ##Default HTML styles
        
        HTML comes with default styles such as different heading sizes, font weights and font sizes. HTML also has default spacing on many of its elements as well.  Notice how there&#39;s a space between the paragraphs and headings too? We can change all of this with CSS.

        The browser looks at every HTML element on the page as a rectangular box. The CSS **Box Model** describes the way CSS styles the size and spacing of HTML elements.

        There are some funny quirks with the box model sizing.  In short, adding the CSS snippet below to your CSS file will fix those quirks. See more about The Box Model [here](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

        ```
        /* apply a natural box layout model to all elements, but allowing components to change */
        html {
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        *, *:before, *:after {
          box-sizing: inherit;
        }

        ##Margin and Padding
        `margin` - adds/removes space **outside** of the element  
        `padding` - adds/removes space **inside** of the element  

        The values for both properties can be declared using 1 to 4 values. A variety of measurement units can be used but today we will use pixels. Setting the value to "0" will *remove* any default space and any positive value will *add* space.

        ```css
        padding: 2px 10px 2px 10px; /* top, right, bottom, left */
        padding: 2px 10px 2px; /* top, right & left, bottom */
        padding: 2px 10px; /* top & bottom, right and left */
        padding: 2px /* all sides have the same value */
        ```

        Both margin and padding can also be used by targeting a specific side.

        ```css
        margin-top: 2px;
        margin-right: 2px;
        margin-bottom: 2px;
        margin-left: 2px;

        ##Class Exercise #8: Update the page spacing

        Notice that the content doesn&#39;t quite go to the edge of the page? That&#39;s because there&#39;s default spacing in the `body` element (as well as many other elements). 

        Remove the test background color and replace it with `padding` and `margin` to reset the value.

        ```
        body {
          padding: 0;
          margin: 0;
        }
        ```
        Also, let&#39;s start adding some padding to the header (space inside) and center align the text.

        ```
        header {
          background: url(../images/baltimore-rowhouses.jpg);
          text-align: center;
          padding: 150px 0;
        }
        ```
        You can adjust this padding value later when we change font sizes.

        ##Background Images, Part 2

        If the image is smaller than the width of your browser window, the image will repeat by default.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/exercise-8-bgrepeat.jpg)

        Let's add three more values: `no-repeat`, `cover` and `fixed`.  The end code will look like this:
        
        ```
        header { /* longhand */
          background-image: url(../images/baltimore-rowhouses.jpg);
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-attachment: fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```
        ```
        header { /* shorthand */
          background: url(../images/baltimore-rowhouses.jpg) no-repeat fixed;
          background-size: cover;
        }
        ```

        Note that <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->`background-size` is the longhand property. To include it in the shorthand style, it **must** be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character. If no background position value is used, background-size wonâ€™t work in the shorthand style so in this case, it may be less error prone to just add it via the longhand property. More about background [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/) and [here](http://www.carsonshold.com/2013/02/css-background-sizecover-doesnt-like-fixed-positioning/).

        ##Inheritance and Specificity

        One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using a family tree relationship between the elements.

        ```
        <body>
          <h1>My Website</h1><!-- child of body -->
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p><!-- sibling of h1 -->
        </body>
        ```
        ```
        body {
          color: blue;
          font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
          color: black;
        }
        ```

        In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the children and descendants so all the text would be blue and display the Helvetica font. However, when a more specific selector is used (`h1`), it overrides the inherited values because it&#39;s more *specific*.

        Services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) make it easier to add variety to your font choices. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their hosted stylesheet and fonts making it available to all users that visit your site.

        1. Select the fonts you want to use and **Add to Collection**.
        1. You can **Review** them to take a closer look, then choose **Use** when ready.
        1. Select font weights. The more you choose, the more it will slow down page load time.
        The default character set should contain what you need. Only select an option if you need to add additional language support.
        1. Grab the <link> code snippet and add it the <head> part of your page.
        1. Use the new fonts with the font-family property as listed in the example on the Google Fonts page.
        
        That&#39;s it!

          ##Class Exercise #9: Typography (continued)

          Make sure the Google Font stylesheet has been added to your HTML page to use the fonts on website. 

          Let&#39;s add the base font to the `body` element, so all the descendant elements can inherit this style.  You can change the `font-weight` too.

          ```
          body {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
            font-weight: 300;
          }
          ```

          Now let&#39;s make all the `<h1>` headings in the page have the same styles too. 

          ```
          h1 {
            font-size: 50px;
            font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive;
          }

          ##Class Exercise #9: Typography (continued)

          What if you want the `h1` in the `header` to look different than all the other `h1` tags? You can use a **descendant selector** to specifically select a tag within another tag.

          ```xml
          <header id="home">
            <h1>Kima Greggs</h1>
          </header>

          h1 {
            font-size: 50px;
            font-family: 'Satisfy', cursive;
          }
          header h1 { 
            font-size: 150px;
            color: black;
          }
          ```

          `header h1` is more specific so it will override the `font-size` in the `h1` declaration.

        p a {
          /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */

        You can skip a level but specificity rules still apply. For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it&#39;s more specific. It&#39;s usually easier to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed.

        ##Chrome Dev Tools

        You can view the source of any web page by right-clicking (or two-finger tap) on *any* web page! Go to http://ladieslearningcode.com and view the source. That's HTML.

        **Chrome Developer tools** take it a step further and allows us to *inspect* any web page making it easier to test and debug code. The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

        * right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**
        * select the menu icon ![](framework/img/workshop/menu-icon-chrome.png) in the top right hand corner and select **Tools > Developer Tools**
        * keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

      ##Metadata

      `<meta>` tags are optional but can provide additional info about the HTML document, using different attributes. The `charset` attribute helps the browser translate computer language (bytes) into characters & symbols and is strongly recommended. Adding a description is also useful for search engine results. 

      Note that the `<meta>` tag does not require a closing tag.

      ```xml
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>Page Title</title>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <meta name="Description" content="Short description about your page">
        </head>
        <body>
          All page content goes here!
        </body>
      </html>
      ```
